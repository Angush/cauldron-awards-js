# Discord Awards

A platform to facilitate community awards events, allowing community members to make nominations, vote on entries, and then peruse the final results.

Currently contains a fair amount of hardcoded data; if you want to use this yourself, you might want to contact me. It also utilizes an API server, written in PHP, which is kept in a separate private repository.
