The end of anything is all it takes to see a flash of neon light or hear the clink of glasses together. Most people who chance upon this phenomenon pay it no mind. They conclude it’s a trick of the eye, something they misheard, or the questionable leftovers they ate an hour ago having unexpected hallucinogenic properties.\n\nTaylor Hebert is not most people.
